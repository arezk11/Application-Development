In this workshop, the Model View Controller helped me organize my code by clearly separating the responsibilities to 3 main parts: Model, View and the Controller, this structure made it very easy for me to manage the different aspects of the project and keep the code more maintainable. The Model was responsible for the instruments and had their details like how do they work, how the sound was made, how to play and fix them. the core behaviour of the instruments were encapsulated in the model which helped keep the data logic separate from the rest of the project. The view was responsible for interacting with the user and displaying the instrument details as well as receiving the input like the prices and then showing the results such as the most expensive instrument. The controller was responsible for handling the main logic it processed the user input like the prices and used the model to get the details like which instrument is the most expensive one, it also was responsible for how the view presents these information to the user.
