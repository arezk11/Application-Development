In this workshop I choose to use a single class in this project to keep things simple, since this is my first small app I tried building it with the new concepts we just learned I built this app that handles the user input and processes pizza orders while keeping everything in one class made the code easier to read and manage but I think for bigger projects the using of multiple classes would be better as it allows us to separate different parts of the code and making it easier to work with and understand for the data structure I used a list to handle the pizza toppings because it is easy to use and fits the size of the data well, all I needed to do it to go through each topping to calculate its prices and a list allowed me to do this easily. Another option could be a HashMap which is faster for finding specific items. But since my focus was about going through the items in order a list was the best choice.
